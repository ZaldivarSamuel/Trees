This directory holds the code to perform a Depth-First search on an adjacency matrix.

Things to improve:
- Convert to adjacency list
- ~~Code adds a vertex to the stack that is already in the stack. Find a way to prevent that.~~


Done:
- No longer adds duplicate vertex to stack. Before adding to stack, the node is mark as visited.
